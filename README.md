# Pathfinding-Visualizer
I was interested in pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize how they work. I built this application using Python 3. We can visualize the following algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms A Search* (weighted): the best fastest pathfinding algorithm (uses heuristics to find the shortest path) Breath-first Search (unweighted): a good algorithm that guarantees the shortest path but is not very fast
If you want to play around just download the repo and launch main.py.
"SpaceBar" for A*
"B" for BFS 
"S" for Dijkstra
"C" to clear the screen
"D" to draw random walls (press D many times if you want to build a labyrinth)
